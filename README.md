# Ask a Manager 2019 Survey Data
This is a repository that has taken the 2019 salary survey from Ask a Manager, a work blog run by Alison Green. 
I downloaded the dataset and cleaned it, to prepare it for Data Analysis. 


Follow this link to access the original blog post and spreadsheet containing the data:

A copy of the dataset used is also present in the data folder. The final cleaned dataset is in the data folder as well.
